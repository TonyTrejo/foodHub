# foodHub
Python project for Data Science | Statistical Practice

Context
The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A food aggregator company FoodHub offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.
The app allows the restaurants to receive a direct online order from a customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up the order after it is confirmed by the restaurant. The delivery person then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person, he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer's location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The customer can rate the order in the app. The food aggregator earns money by collecting a fixed margin of the delivery order from the restaurants.
Objective
The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. Suppose you are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company to improve the business. 
Data Description
The data contains the different data related to a food order. The detailed data dictionary is given below.
Data Dictionary
order_id: Unique ID of the order
customer_id: ID of the customer who ordered the food
restaurant_name: Name of the restaurant
cuisine_type: Cuisine ordered by the customer
cost: Cost of the order
day_of_the_week: Indicates whether the order is placed on a weekday or weekend (The weekday is from Monday to Friday and the weekend is Saturday and Sunday)
rating: Rating given by the customer out of 5
food_preparation_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the restaurant to prepare the food. This is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the restaurant's order confirmation and the delivery person's pick-up confirmation.
delivery_time: Time (in minutes) taken by the delivery person to deliver the food package. This is calculated by taking the difference between the timestamps of the delivery person's pick-up confirmation and drop-off information
 
Submission Guidelines
A learner notebook has been shared to guide you through the project, perform the analysis in the right manner, and generate insights from the data. It is mandatory to download the same and follow the instructions mentioned in it to complete the project. 
There are two parts to the submission: 
A well commented solution notebook prepared from the learner notebook [format - .html]
A presentation as you would present to the Data Science team [format - .pdf] 
Any assignment found copied/plagiarized with other groups will not be graded and awarded zero marks.
Please ensure timely submission as any submission post-deadline will not be accepted for evaluation.
Submission will not be evaluated if
it is submitted post-deadline, or,
more than 2 files are submitted.
 
Best Practices for Notebook
The final notebook should be well-documented, with inline comments explaining the functionality of code and markdown cells containing comments on the observations and insights.
The notebook should be run from start to finish in a sequential manner before submission.
It is important to remove all warnings and errors before submission.
The notebook should be submitted as an HTML file (.html) and NOT as a notebook file (.ipynb).
It is recommended that you read the problem statement and go through the criteria and description mentioned in the rubric before starting the project.
Please refer to the FAQ page for common project-related queries.
 
Best Practices for Presentation
The presentation should be made keeping in mind that the audience will be the Data Science team of a company.
The key points in the presentation should be the following:
Business Overview of the problem and solution approach
Key findings and insights which can drive business decisions
Business recommendations
Focus on explaining the key takeaways in an easy-to-understand manner.
The inclusion of the potential benefits of implementing the solution will give you the edge.
Copying and pasting from the notebook is not a good idea, and it is better to avoid showing codes unless they are the focal point of your presentation.
The presentation should be submitted as a PDF file (.pdf) and NOT as a .pptx file.
A presentation template has been provided for reference. It is not mandatory to use it for submission.
